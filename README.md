# Python-Projects

**Galaxy**: Project to test K-means for predicting galaxy centers from images of space.

**qLearn**: Implementation of Q-Learning algorithm. Includes classes for Frogger arcade game/agent, and visualization methods.

**edgeDetectory**: Edge detection algorithms.

**resolutionDatabase**: for generating x, y and weight images for upResNet

**train_test_script**: script for creating, restoring, training, testing upResNet models

**upResNet**: fully-conv CNN for predicting higher res images from lower res ones. Requires image_util.py from https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet. *Minor modifications have been made to image_util to better fit the problem

**upResNet_v2**: version of upResNet that allows for multiple resizing options from the same model. Has many bugs.
